# StructuredRAGnarok

Welcome to StructuredRAGnarok, the comprehensive repository for implementing Structured Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches utilizing various query engines and knowledge graph methodologies. This project aims to bridge the gap between complex data retrieval and machine learning models, enhancing the capabilities of both.

## Introduction

StructuredRAGnarok integrates advanced RAG techniques with diverse query engines and knowledge graphs to facilitate robust and scalable solutions for information retrieval and generation tasks. By leveraging structured data, the project aims to improve the precision and context-awareness of generated content.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Easily integrate with various query engines and knowledge graphs.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large-scale data sets and complex queries.
- **Flexibility**: Supports multiple programming languages and frameworks.
- **Community-Driven**: Open to contributions and collaborative improvement.

## Installation

To get started with StructuredRAGHub, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StructuredRAGHub.git
cd StructuredRAGHub
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Here is a basic example of how to use the StructuredRAGHub in your code:

```bash
from structured_rag import RAGModel

# Initialize the model with your configuration
model = RAGModel(config_path="config.json")

# Query your data
response = model.query("What is the latest research on retrieval models?")
print(response)
```
